# Woolhud
This is a recreation of the HUD woolen is seen using in his YouTube videos and in his Twitch streams if you're into watching those.

I am not the creator of this remake, I simply forked it off http://www.teamfortress.tv/46585/woolhud
The creator has stated that he has stopped work on this HUD, so I decided to maintain it and fix up some issues.

Do NOT contact Woolen about this HUD. Ever. This is an unofficial fork of an unofficial HUD remake. For any issues, contact me on Steam.

# Important Information
This HUD is for 16:9 resolution users so if you play with 4:3 IN GAME, nevermind that you have 16:9 monitor, you have to play IN GAME 16:9 
DO NOT remove any file from this hud exept readme or sound you can delete this
